            <h2>My history with I.T</h2>
            <p>Since I was a kid, I have always liked technology at all. I loved studying computer and video game related topics.<br>Questions like "How do i build my own website?" or "How can I make my own game?" were constantly on my head.<br>I observed its impact to the world and felt a strong desire to not just be a spectator, but to be part of its development.<br>So, when I become 18, in 2023, I entered college to study Computer Science at Estácio de Sá.<br> Since then, I have been extremely grateful for being able to participate in the world I so desired.</p><br>
            <p>Now i'm here creating this website at 3 A.M. Cool, right?</p>

            <h2>About my English</h2>
            <p>I admited that I learned some English in elementary school, but it wasn't very deep. As I said, I spent a lot of time on the computer surfing the Internet, so I learned a lot from this.<br> I used to watch videos, play games, visit to forums, listen to music and many others types of content in English.<br> After a long time, I took an English course in my neighborhood called Fisk, but I already had the knowledge I gained. Due to personal problems I stayed for a year and then left.</p><br>
            <p>Nowadays I continue to practice English everyday.</p>
